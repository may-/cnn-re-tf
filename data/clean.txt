The 1992 constitution accords greater powers to the Crimean parliament including full sovereign powers to establish relations with other states , therefore many Western and Ukrainian commentators argued that both provided referendum choices would result in de facto separation from <Q212> .  The Supreme Council of Crimea considered the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution as a coup and the new interim government in <Q1899> as illegitimate and stated that the referendum was a response to these developments .
The Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People called for a boycott of the referendum . Russia officially recognized the results of the Crimean referendum and states that unilateral Kosovo declaration of independence has set a precedent , which allows secession of <Q7835> from <Q212> .

<Q7835> and Sevastopol are neighboring subdivisions of <Q212> located in the Crimean peninsula , a region with a long and complex history .
<Q7835> became part of independent <Q212> after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , shortly after Crimea had re-gained its autonomy following a 1991 referendum .
Polling by the Razumkov Centre in 2008 found that 63.8 % of Crimeans -LRB- 76 % of Russians , 55 % of Ukrainians , and 14 % of Crimean Tatars , respectively -RRB- would like <Q7835> to secede from <Q212> and join Russia and 53.8 % would like to preserve its current status , but with expanded powers and rights .
UNDP in <Q7835> conducted series of polls about possible referendum on joining Russia with a sample size of 1200 : Different polls conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology -LRB- KIIS -RRB- in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea found a 36 % support for unification of the entire <Q212> with Russia in 2013 and 41 % on 8 -- 18 February 2014 -LRB- just days before the ousting of Viktor Yanukovych -RRB- .
The survey found that 82 % of Crimeans `` fully endorse '' <Q7835> 's secession from <Q212> and joining the Russian federation , and that 11 % of Crimeans `` mostly endorse '' Crimea 's secession from Ukraine and joining the Russian federation , while just 7 % `` disapprove '' of Crimea 's secession from Ukraine and joining the Russian federation .

While the authors of that survey felt and opined that <Q7835> 's secession was `` an illegal act under international law , '' they also acknowledged `` It is also an act that enjoys the widespread support of the peninsula 's inhabitants , with the important exception of its Crimean Tatar population . ''  Despite the survey 's distinction of Crimean Tatar support for accession to Russia being lower than the support from the rest of Crimea 's population , the survey still found that significantly more Crimean Tatars either felt that Crimea 's secession from <Q212> and accession to Russia was either the `` Absolutely right decision , '' or the `` Generally right decision , '' than the number of Crimean Tatars who felt that the 2014 referendum outcome was the `` Wrong decision .

The interim Ukrainian government , United States , European Union , and several other nations stated that any referendum held by the local government of <Q7835> without the express authority of <Q212> is unconstitutional and illegitimate .
Andriy Krysko , head of the Crimean branch of the Voters Committee of Ukraine , announced that no one from the parliament secretariat was in the building when voting took place .  Originally the referendum was to be about the status of <Q7835> within <Q212> and was initially set for May 25 , but later , on March 1 , it was pushed back to March 30 .
The Verkhovna Rada of <Q212> will initiate dissolution of the parliament of the <Q756294> .

For the second choice , it was unclear whether the 1992 constitution was to be adopted in its original form or in its amended form .  The original 1992 constitution was adopted together with a declaration of independence , but parliament then amended the constitution one day later to affirm that <Q7835> `` was a part of <Q212> '' .
What does n't help for consensus concerning the legal basis of <Q7835> 's March 16 referendum is that the reactions of many nations to the referendum , particularly of Western-nations , were actually addressing the matter of Crimean secession from <Q212> , whereas the Crimean referendum itself was not about secession from Ukraine , but took Crimea 's secession from Ukraine to already be de-facto following its government 's declaration : Crimea 's March 16 referendum occurred following the March 11 declaration of Crimea 's independence from Ukraine made by Crimea 's parliament , which was made following a successful parliamentary vote of 78 in favour of , and 22 against Crimea 's secession from Ukraine .

As it turned out , however , the note officially breaking diplomatic relations with the United States was delivered late , and he correctly perceived the Americans would be resolved upon revenge and unwilling to negotiate .

But when the British , as well as the Americans , expressed no interest in negotiating with <Q3476248> for any cease fire , the Japanese thoughts turned to securing their newly seized territory and acquiring more with an eye toward attempting to force one or more of their enemies out of the war .

Yamamoto rushed planning for the Midway and Aleutians missions , while dispatching a force under Naval Major-General Takeo Takagi , including the Fifth Carrier Division -LRB- the large , new carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku -RRB- , to support the effort to seize the islands of Tulagi and Guadalcanal for seaplane and aeroplane bases , and the town of <Q36526> on <Q691> 's south coast facing Australia .
<Q3476248> could not hope to match the <Q30> in quantities of well-trained replacement pilots , and the quality of both Japanese land-based and naval aviation began declining .  Particularly harmful , however , were losses of numerous destroyers in the unsuccessful Tokyo Express supply runs .

Later on , Yamamoto convinces <Q3476248> to join forces with the <Q30> and Britain to defeat Nazi Germany .

Arafat 's organization never embraced the ideologies of the major Arab governments of the time , in contrast to other Palestinian factions , which often became satellites of nations such as Egypt , <Q796> , <Q851> , Syria and others .
According to Said Aburish , the government of Jordan and a number of Fatah commandos informed Arafat that large-scale Israeli military preparations for an attack on the town were underway , prompting fedayeen groups , such as <Q298649> 's newly formed <Q212884> -LRB- PFLP -RRB- and Nayef Hawatmeh 's breakaway organization the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine -LRB- DFLP -RRB- , to withdraw their forces from the town .
<Q6086734> and the <Q30> have alleged also that Arafat was involved in the 1973 Khartoum diplomatic assassinations , in which five diplomats and five others were killed .

Though he had frequently been accused of and associated with terrorism , in speeches on 13 and 14 December Arafat repudiated ` terrorism in all its forms , including state terrorism ' .

The reluctance to give accurate polling answers has sometimes extended to post-election exit polls as well .  The race of the pollster conducting the interview may factor into voters ' answers .  Some analysts have dismissed the theory of the Bradley effect , or argued that it may have existed in past elections , but not in more recent ones , such as when <Q76> was elected and reelected President of the <Q30> in 2008 and 2012 respectively .
Other elections which have been cited as possible demonstrations of the Bradley effect include the 1983 race for Mayor of Chicago , the 1988 Democratic primary race in <Q8027102> for President of the <Q30> , and the 1989 race for Mayor of New York City .
In 2007 , Jindal ran again , this time securing an easy victory , with his final vote total remaining in line with or stronger than the predictions of the polls conducted shortly before the election .  In 2006 , there was speculation that the Bradley effect might appear in the <Q7700003> race for <Q30> Senator between Harold Ford , Jr. and white candidate Bob Corker .
<Q1659729> lost by a slim margin , but an examination of exit polling data indicated that the percentage of white voters who voted for him remained close to the percentage that indicated they would do so in polls conducted prior to the election .  Several other 2006 biracial contests saw pre-election polls predict their respective elections ' final results with similar accuracy .  In the race for <Q30> Senator from Maryland , black Republican candidate Michael Steele lost by a wider margin than predicted by late polls .
The 2008 presidential campaign of <Q76> , a black <Q30> Senator , brought a heightened level of scrutiny to the Bradley effect , as observers searched for signs of the effect in comparing Obama 's polling numbers to the actual election results during the Democratic primary elections .
